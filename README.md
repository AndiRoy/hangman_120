# hangman_120
Coding project for CSE 120/Hangman

I have made very few little changes for a while, where I had stopped on the project, was after trying to 
implement a difficulty menu for the user to choose which one they would like, but you can see when running the code
that theres an issue where it just displays the 'Easy' box on the whole screen. Also keep in mind we need
to change the name of a lot of the variables which I haven't done yet, I just wanted to try and get the code 
running first. 
The drawings and 'word.txt' are more temporary as well, the drawings are not polished but I just wanted to test
them, as well as the word.txt, which really doesn't have much.
